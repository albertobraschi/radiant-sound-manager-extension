= SoundManager

Provides Radiant[http://www.radiantcms.org/] with support for
SoundManager2[http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/].
Includes SoundManager V2.90a.20081028.

== Usage

Before using, copy the SoundManager resources into your public directory:

  rake radiant:extensions:sound_manager:update

To make SoundManager available on your page:

  <r:sound_manager [debug="true"] />

If +debug+ is present, the debugging version of SoundManager will be
used.  This means that SoundManager will log diagnostic messages to
the console, or just all over your page.  (See the SoundManager
documentation.)

== Inline player

To use the inline player (transform all MP3 links on the page to play
with SoundManager, without leaving the page or downloading the MP3):

  <r:sound_manager:inlineplayer />

OR

  <r:sound_manager [debug="true"]><r:inlineplayer /></r:sound_manager>

The extension installs a default stylesheet in
/stylesheets/sound_manager/inlineplayer.css (and supporting images in
/images/sound_manager/inlineplayer) but the stylesheet is not
automatically applied by the +inlineplayer+ tag.  You'll have to
create the link yourself.

You may very well want to write your own stylesheet instead.
The CSS file has instructions.
